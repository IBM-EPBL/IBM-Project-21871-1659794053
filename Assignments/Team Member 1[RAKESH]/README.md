The need for fire alarm systems nowadays is a serious demand. As the number of fire accidents are increasing every day, there has to be something that will keep us safe.
We are all aware of the high end security systems present in the market but they are not easily available to everyone. 
We therefore intend to provide a solution by constructing a cost efficient electronic system that has the capability of sensing the gas and setting off the alarm. 
The basic idea behind this project is that to sense the fire in room and alert the emergency services.
But, it can be detected by electronic gas sensor. 
The project involves the use of Arduino, gas sensor, Potentiometer, buzzer, LED, LCD display and a simple program. 
The sensor detect any gas in its permissible range and triggers the alarm. 
It will also send the signal to Arduino which processes the signal and set off the alarm along with detection message on display.
